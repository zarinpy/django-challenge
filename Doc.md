Race conditions in ticket selling scenarios can occur when multiple users try to buy the same ticket(s) simultaneously. To handle this in a Django application, you can employ various strategies:

### Use Database Transactions:
- **Atomic Transactions:** Use Django's atomic transactions to ensure that critical sections of code execute atomically, preventing interference between concurrent transactions.
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Employ database-level locks to prevent concurrent access to critical resources. For example, when a user tries to buy a ticket, lock the ticket or related resources until the transaction is complete.

### Implement Reservation Mechanisms: (selected solution) 
- **Reservation System:** When a user selects a seat, temporarily reserve it for a short duration (e.g., a few minutes) while they complete the purchase. If the purchase is not completed within the reservation time, release the seat for others to buy.
  
### Optimistic Concurrency Control:
- **Use Versioning:** Implement versioning or timestamps on ticket records. When a user attempts to buy a ticket, ensure the version/timestamp matches the current version. If not, it means the ticket has been modified since the user loaded the page, preventing the purchase.

### Throttling and Rate Limiting:
- **Rate Limit API Endpoints:** Implement rate limiting on the purchase endpoints to control the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame, preventing excessive requests and reducing the chance of race conditions.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Error Handling:** Clearly communicate to users when a ticket they attempted to buy is no longer available due to concurrent purchases.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging mechanisms to monitor and track potential race conditions. This helps in identifying issues and implementing improvements.

Combining these strategies can significantly reduce the likelihood of race conditions during ticket sales. Itâ€™s essential to test these mechanisms thoroughly to ensure they work effectively under various scenarios and loads.
