Race conditions in ticket selling scenarios can occur when multiple users try to buy the same ticket(s) simultaneously. To handle this in a Django application, you can employ various strategies:

### Use Database Transactions:
- **Atomic Transactions:** Use Django's atomic transactions to ensure that critical sections of code execute atomically, preventing interference between concurrent transactions.
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Employ database-level locks to prevent concurrent access to critical resources. For example, when a user tries to buy a ticket, lock the ticket or related resources until the transaction is complete.

### Implement Reservation Mechanisms: (selected solution) 
- **Reservation System:** When a user selects a seat, temporarily reserve it for a short duration (e.g., a few minutes) while they complete the purchase. If the purchase is not completed within the reservation time, release the seat for others to buy.
  
### Optimistic Concurrency Control:
- **Use Versioning:** Implement versioning or timestamps on ticket records. When a user attempts to buy a ticket, ensure the version/timestamp matches the current version. If not, it means the ticket has been modified since the user loaded the page, preventing the purchase.

### Throttling and Rate Limiting:
- **Rate Limit API Endpoints:** Implement rate limiting on the purchase endpoints to control the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame, preventing excessive requests and reducing the chance of race conditions.
